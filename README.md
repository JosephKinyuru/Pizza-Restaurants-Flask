# Project Description
Pizza-Restaurants is a API project that focuses on restful API and its applications on a local scale. Because its mostly based on your local machine its best used on postman especially for `POST` requests but for `GET` requests it can also work on browsers.

# How to launch project
- Cd into server directory `cd server`
- Seed the database `python3 seed.py`   (Optional)
- Run the application `flask run` or `python3 app.py`
- Open the provided link in postman or on browser

**Note** 
-  The restful API is based on JSON format so all `POST` requests should be in JSON and the responses will also be in JSON.
-  If you post data into the database then run `seed.py` the data will be deleted. Its better to post after running seed.py so that you can view your data.
- The seed data is mainly for helping to visualize the `GET` responses.
